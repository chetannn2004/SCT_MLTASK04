# 🎗️ SCT_ML_04 – Breast Cancer Classification using SVM

## 📌 Task Objective
To build a machine learning model that classifies breast cancer tumors as **benign or malignant** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**. The goal is to leverage Support Vector Machines (SVM) for accurate and efficient medical predictions.

## 🧠 What I Did
- Loaded the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`  
- Explored key features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness  
- Checked for missing values and scaled features for better model performance  
- Applied **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification  
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visualized the confusion matrix and classification report  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Output
- Successfully trained an SVM classifier that predicts tumor type (Benign or Malignant)  
- Achieved high accuracy and recall, critical for healthcare applications  
- Generated insights into which features are most relevant for classification  

## 📚 What I Learned
- Hands-on application of **SVM** in healthcare-related data  
- How to preprocess real-world diagnostic data for classification  
- Importance of **model evaluation** metrics in sensitive applications like cancer detection  
- Best practices for medical ML pipelines (e.g., scaling, cross-validation, interpretability)
